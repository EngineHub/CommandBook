#
# This is the default kit file for CommandBook.
#
# Each kit requires the commandbook.kit.[name] permission, such as:
# commandbook.kit.starter (as seen below).
#
# The name of the items are names that you can use with the /item command,
# so you can do step:wood if you want. If you want to specify an amount, enter
# the number after a comma, like "wood,64".
#
# If you put <name>=# for a kit, then you can choose a "cool down" period
# in seconds. Players have to wait that amount of time before they can
# use that particular kit.
