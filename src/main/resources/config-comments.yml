components: |
    A list of enabled and disabled components. Components in the disabled list 
    will automatically be removed from the enabled list. Fully qualified class names can 
    or aliases (automatically added to the list by CommandBook) can be used as component names.

component: |
    Configurations for CommandBook's built-in components are stored here.
    Custom component configurations are stored as individual files in the the config/ folder

# This is a rather ugly way of handling command conflicts, but I'm keeping the comment in 
# here just in case somebody has a really good reason to add it back someday
disabled-commands: |
    CommandBook commands can be added to this list, WITHOUT a preceding /, will not be 
    registered. Other plugins can then register their conflicting commands.
 
# This is the future! A bit tricky to explain though :V
low-priority-command-registration: |
    When this setting is enabled, CommandBook's commands will be registered AFTER every 
    other plugin's commands. If any other plugin registers a command that conflicts with
    one of CommandBook's commands, the CommandBook command will be accessible with 
    /commandbook:<command>, and the other plugin's command will be accessible 
    with /<command>
    
op-permissions: Give operators (set with the Minecraft /op command) all permissions.
crappy-wrapper-compat: Disables some features to be compatible with badly-written server wrappers.
use-display-names: Use users' display names rather than than their raw username in various messages. Display names are set by other plugins.
lookup-with-display-names: Similar to use-display-names, this allows usage of users' display names when looking up players.
broadcast-changes: For /time, /weather, and other commands, broadcast change messages to everyone when you change world information with the commands.
console-broadcast-name: The display name of the console when commands are issued through the console. No-Effect with broadcast-changes set to false.
